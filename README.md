## Fitlog's Readme


### Intro

- I was looking for a good and free workout tracking app that I could access from everywhere, but also one that would enable me to see my progress. 
- You can start using it in literally 30sec, just input a name and it'll create it, no need for an account !
- The progress charts can be generated in the Charts page, it'll use the total volume for the selected exercise in each workout.
- This project is purely a training project. It's my first full, complete, solo and finished project using React and Firebase, and honestly I'm pretty proud of it. 

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- The idea around the unique URL to access your content is from one of those "Everytime you build a Todo list, a puppy dies" kind of article. One of project was ironically a Todo list with a unique URL for each list. The idea was great, so I "stole" it, so the app is de facto crossplatform, sometimes I like working out at home, so I can use the app on my MacBook, or when I'm at the gym, I can use my phone. 
- I like charts, I like working out, and my main motivation is seeing the numbers go up, and there aren't THAT many apps that feature charts for free, so I decided to do this on my own. It really helps to keep me motivated.
- It's one of my first project on which I really focused on the design. Sure it's not fancy, but it's efficient, it's not cluttered, and the informations are where they're supposed to be. 

### How to use ?

- Go to https://fitlog-aef73.firebaseapp.com/
- Type in the name you want for your workout log
- Bookmark the link that is given to you ( super important, unless you want to spend your whole time going to your browser history )
- ???
- Profit

### TODO

- There's nothing planned at the moment, I consider it finished, though some new features can be developed if people ask for a specific feature ( I'm so popular I'm overwhelmed by all the messages I receive ), or if I feel like there's something missing.
